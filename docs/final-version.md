title: Final paper submissions

Below are the general *ACL policies for preparing the final version of your paper (sometimes still anachronistically called the "camera-ready").

If your question is not answered here, please email the current publications chairs for any questions or clarifications.
We will update this page if new issues arise.

## Formatting

The final version of your paper should incorporate the comments of the reviewers as well as other changes you see fit to make. 
In addition, be sure to do all of the following:

- Ensure that your paper conforms to the [Formatting Guidelines](formatting.html).
- Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title.
- De-anonymize references to your own work in the body of the paper.
- Ensure that all [tables, graphs, and figures](formatting.html#figures-and-tables) are readable.
- Ensure that the paper does not exceed the [page limit](formatting.html#paper-length). Most *ACL conferences allow one extra page to address reviewer comments.
- If appropriate, add an [Acknowledgments section](formatting.html#acknowledgements).
- Check the [paper size and embedded fonts](formatting.html#file-format).

## Submitting the final version in START

You may submit the final version of your paper by navigating to your conference START login (for example, for ACL 2020, it was here: [https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/user].
From there, follow internal links.
You should have received an email with more information about this procedure.

### Metadata

It is very important that your paper's metadata (title, author names, and abstract) is entered correctly.
It is used on the conference website, handbook, mobile app, and the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) (and propagates to [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de), Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, etc).

Before the metadata is entered, please have all authors ensure that their names are correctly set in [their global START profiles](https://www.softconf.com/l/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile), because <font color="red">authors' names will appear in the conference proceedings as set in their global START profiles</font>.

If your paper's title or other metadata has changed since submission, please edit those metadata fields when you upload the camera-ready version, so that they will appear correctly in the table of contents, author index, conference schedule, etc.

Note: Your conference may or may not allow authors to be added or reordered after submission.
Please check with your conference.

When entering author names, please note carefully the following information:

* Unicode (UTF-8) can be used for accented or special characters.

* Names are **not** written in all caps or all lowercase.

* The "Last Name" is the name(s) by which your paper is to be cited.
  It is usually a family name, even for authors from cultures where the family name is written first.
  If you have only one name, please enter it here.

* The "First Name" is usually a given name or names, including middle names/initials.

The title and abstract should be written using Unicode (UTF-8) with LaTeX commands.
Please try to follow these guidelines:

 - In titles, please capitalize the first word, the first word
   after a colon (`:`), and all other words except the following
   "little words": articles, prepositions, coordinating
   conjunctions, and the infinitive marker "to." This includes
   hyphenated words like `Mixed-Case`.

 - The ACL Anthology automatically detects most proper nouns and noun
   phrases that should always be capitalized. However, if your paper
   title contains a very uncommon proper noun, you can put curly
   braces around its first letter, like this:
   `{T}aumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu}`.
 
   Note that these curly braces will _not_ appear in the online
   conference program or proceedings. They will only appear in the
   BibTeX file that others will use to cite your paper.

 - If you need literal curly braces, please escape them like this:
   `\{` `\}`

 - Please don't use any nonstandard LaTeX commands.

 - The title and abstract should not contains footnotes or citations.

 - You can use LaTeX math mode where appropriate: `An $O(n^2)$
   Algorithm for $n$-gram Smoothing`.

 - You can use Unicode (UTF-8) for accented or special characters.

 - Please don't copy-and-paste the abstract from your PDF file, but if
   you must, please be sure to rejoin words broken by hyphenation.

## Copyright

When you submit the paper, you will be asked to sign the [ACL Copyright Transfer Agreement](https://github.com/ACLPUB/blob/master/templates/copyright/acl-copyright-transfer.pdf) on behalf of all authors, either electronically (via the START Conference Manager) or physically.
Authors retain many rights under this agreement and it is appropriate in the vast majority of cases.
Please contact the publication chairs with any concerns regarding copyright.

Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and, if applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to
sign on their behalf.
Please sign your full name (not just your first or last initials).
