**To be written by Alexander**


- normalize author names; and how to edit them in aclpub

- diacritics in author names

- contents of the proceedings.tgz file

- how to enter the metadata

- this is what each book chair sends us (and what we produce for the
  main conf)

- things that can go wrong, and how to fix them (e.g. missing Bibtex
  files; Unicode characters in Bibtex)






ACLPUB does a reasonable
  job at converting characters with funny diacritics to Latex and HTML
  entities, but its support for Unicode is not complete, to the extent
  that the proceedings.tgz 


book.pdf vs proceedings.tgz

ensure well-formed bibtex
