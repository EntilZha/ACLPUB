On this page, we list general advice that didn't fit anywhere else.

* Set up a mailing list at which the publication chairs and all
  student assistants who support you in your work can be reached.
  Authors will forget to send questions and requests to that address,
  but you can put it in cc when you respond, so everyone on the team
  can keep track of where everything stands.

* It is a really good idea to set up a mailing list that contains
  *all* book chairs (including all chairs of each workshop, not just
  the one who is the official contact person) and communicate
  frequently.  This is because in some cases
  corresponding chairs did not forward emails to other organizers,
  which cause a serious problem in communication.

* Each book has its own site in the START system (make sure they do;
  sometimes the tutorials etc. forget because their is no real
  reviewing, but they still need to use START to produce their
  proceedings). Make sure you have manager access to each, so you can
  edit their metadata. You may think that it's a good idea to let each
  workshop chair set up their metadata themselves, but we strongly
  recommend that you invest the effort to fill them all in by yourself
  early.  This will pay off later when you avoid watching each book
  chair figuring out the intricacies of the metadata themselves.
  


* from now on, can always use A4 paper
