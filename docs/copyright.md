title: Copyright transfer

Publication chairs are also responsible for collecting signed
copyright transfer forms.

Currently, authors of camera-ready papers are asked to electronically
sign copyright transfer forms when they upload their papers.
Therefore, what publication chairs must do is to check whether all
paper submissions accompany with correct signatures.  However, in a
few cases, authors cannot sign forms.  In these cases, you have to
contact the authors directly to solve copyright issues.

## Checking copyright signatures

You can obtain a complete list of copyright signatures via the ACLPUB
tool in START.  Go to the "ACLPUB" page, and "Generate" -> "Copyright
Signatures" produces a text file containing all copyright signatures.
Your task is to check whether each paper is correctly signed.  You
have to contact authors directly if you find any paper that lacks
correct signatures.

## Contact authors to solve copyright issues

Some authors cannot sign copyright transfer forms because of some
regulations of an institute they belong to.  In such cases, you have
to contact authors directly to solve copyright issues.  Typical cases
are:

* Some institutes or companies do not allow to transfer all the rights
  to ACL.  In such cases, at least ACL requires "license to publish"
  in any forms, including printed, online, CD-ROM, etc.  Ask authors
  to prepare a licensing form including "license to publish" and to
  send you signed forms.
* US government work does not require copyright (see
  http://www.usa.gov/copyright.shtml).  In this case, you do not have
  to do anything.
