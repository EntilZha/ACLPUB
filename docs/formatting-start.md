### When and where do I send the final version of my paper?

You may submit the final version of your paper by navigating to your conference START login (for example, for ACL 2020, it was here: [https://www.softconf.com/acl2020/papers/user].
From there, follow internal links.
You should have received an email with more information about this procedure.

### How should I record my name in the START system?

As described in the [formatting guidelines for metadata](formatting.html#how-do-i-enter-metadata), the metadata (title, author, abstract) that you enter into START is very important, because it is used on the conference website, handbook, mobile app, and the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) (and in turn propagates to [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de), Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, etc).

On particularly important component is your name.
When uploading the final version of a paper, you can enter your co-authors' names directly, or access them through their START IDs.
It is easier to do that latter since it copies information from their global profiles.
Please ensure that each author has *carefully read* [the formatting guidelines for names](formatting.html#how-do-i-enter-metadata) to ensure that their names are entered correctly in [their Global START profiles](https://www.softconf.com/l/super/scmd.cgi?ucmd=updateProfile).
That looks like this:

Names can also be entered manually, in which case the same guidelines apply.
Names in the metadata ideally match those listed in the author block in the final copy PDF.

Note: Your conference may or may not allow authors to be added or reordered after submission.
Please check with your conference organizers.

###  What about other metadata?

You will also be prompted to enter your paper's title and abstract.
Be sure to update these if they have changed since the review version.
Again, **please carefully note** [the formatting guidelines](formatting.html#how-do-i-enter-metadata).
