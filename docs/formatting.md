The following instructions are for authors of papers submitted for review to ACL conferences (hereafter, "review version") or paper accepted for publication in its proceedings (hereafter, "final version").
All authors are required to adhere to these specifications.
Authors of accepted papers are advised also to [review the final submission FAQ](final-version.html).

## Style Files

*ACL provides style files for LaTeX and Microsoft Word that meet these requirements. They can be found here:

> https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates

We strongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been appropriately tailored for the *ACL proceedings.

## Paper Length

The conference accepts submissions of long papers and short papers.
Review versions of long papers may have up to eight (8) pages of content plus unlimited pages for references.
Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content plus unlimited pages for acknowledgements and references – so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
Review versions of short papers may have up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references.
Final versions of short papers may have up to five (5) pages, plus unlimited pages for acknowledgements and references.
For both long and short papers, all figures and tables that are part of the main text must fit within these page limits.

The conference encourages submission of appendices and supplementary material, which are not required to fit within these page limits. However, review versions of papers must be self-contained: it is optional for reviewers to look at appendices or supplementary material. Please see [Appendices](#appendices) and [Supplementary Material](#supplementary-material) for more information.

Review versions should not refer, for further detail, to documents, code or data resources that are not available to the reviewers.

Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.

Workshop chairs may have different rules for allowed length and whether appendices or supplementary materials are welcome.
As always, the respective call for papers is the authoritative source.

## Anonymity

As reviewing will be double-blind, review versions must not include any identifying information about the authors (such as names, affiliations, or URLs).
Self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,

> We previously showed (Gusfield, 1997)...

must be avoided, and anonymous citations, e.g.,

> We previously showed (Anonymous, 1997)...

should also be avoided. Instead, use citations such as

> Gusfield (1997) previously showed...

Review versions must not include acknowledgements.

**Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.**

Any preliminary non-archival versions of submitted papers should be listed in the submission form but not in the review version of the paper.
Reviewers are generally aware that authors may present preliminary versions of their work in other venues, but will not be provided the list of previous presentations from the submission form.

Once a paper has been accepted to the conference, the final version should include the author's names and affiliations, and is allowed to use self-references.

## Multiple Submission

Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time in the START submission form, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by *ACL.
Authors of papers accepted for presentation at *ACL must notify the program chairs by the deadline for final versions ("camera-ready deadline") whether the paper will be presented.
We will not accept for publication or presentation any papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere.

Authors submitting more than one paper to *ACL must ensure that submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.

## Formatting Instructions

### File Format

Papers must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).
Please make sure that your PDF file embeds all necessary fonts (especially for tree diagrams, symbols, and Asian languages).
When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just non-standard fonts.
Please make sure that you select the option of including *all* the fonts.
**Before sending it, test your PDF by printing it from a computer different from the one where it was created.**

Some word processors may generate very large PDF files, where each page is rendered as an image.
Such images may reproduce poorly.
In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the PDF.

All papers must use **A4 paper format** (21 cm x 29.7 cm).
Papers must not be submitted with any other paper size.

If you cannot meet the above requirements, please contact the publication chairs as soon as possible.

### Layout

All text except for page numbers must fit within the margins.

Review versions should have page numbers, centered in the bottom margin, but **pages should not be numbered in the final version.**

Manuscripts must be set in two columns.
Exceptions to the two-column format include the title, authors' names and complete addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and any full-width figures or tables.

The exact dimensions for a page on A4 paper are:

* Left margin: 2.5 cm
* Right margin: 2.5 cm
* Top margin: 2.5 cm
* Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
* Column width: 7.7 cm
* Column height: 24.7 cm
* Gap between columns: 0.6 cm

In the review version, a ruler (line numbers in the left and right margins of the article) should be printed, so that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper.
The ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
The final version should not contain a ruler.

**Reviewers:**
If the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper, you can also use fractional references (e.g., "line 295.5").

### Fonts

All text (except non-Latin scripts and mathematical formulas) should be set in **Times Roman**.
If Times Roman is unavailable, you may use **Times New Roman** or **Computer Modern Roman.**

The following table specifies what font sizes and styles must be used for each type of text in the manuscript.

| Type of Text          | Font Size | Style |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----- |
| paper title           | 15 pt     | bold  |
| author names          | 12 pt     | bold  |
| author affiliation    | 12 pt     |       |
| the word "Abstract"   | 12 pt     | bold  |
| section titles        | 12 pt     | bold  |
| subsection titles     | 11 pt     | bold  |
| document text         | 11 pt     |       |
| captions              | 10 pt     |       |
| abstract text         | 10 pt     |       |
| bibliography          | 10 pt     |       |
| footnotes             | 9 pt      |       |

### Title and Authors

Center the title and the author name(s) and affiliation(s) across both columns.

Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in 15-point bold.
Long titles should be typed on two lines without a blank line intervening.
Put the title 2.5 cm from the top of the page.
Write the title in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case); do not write the title in all capital letters, except for acronyms and names (e.g., "BLEU") that are normally written in all capitals.

Place the author name(s) and affiliation(s) under the title.
Write authors' full names; do not abbreviate given names to initials, unless they are normally written as initials ("Margaret Mitchell", not "M. Mitchell").
Do not format surnames in all capitals ("Mitchell", not "MITCHELL").

Do not use footnotes for affiliations.
The affiliation should contain the author's complete address, and if possible, an electronic mail address.

The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical to those entered to the paper submission website in order to maintain the consistency of author information among all publications of the conference.
If they are different, the publication chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it is in your own interest to double-check that the information is consistent.

Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the page.
**Even in the review version of the paper, you should maintain space for names and addresses so that they will fit in the final version.**

### Abstract

Type the abstract at the beginning of the first column.
Center the word **Abstract** in 12 point bold above the body of the abstract.
The width of the abstract should be smaller than the
normal column width by 0.6 cm on each side.
The abstract text should be 10 point roman, single-spaced.

The abstract should be a concise summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper.
It should be no longer than 200 words.

### Text

Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after the abstract, continuing in two columns.
The text should be 11 point roman, single-spaced.

Indent 0.4 cm when starting a new paragraph, except for the first paragraph in a section.

### Sections

Use numbered sections (Arabic numerals) to facilitate cross references.
Number subsections with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot, in Arabic numerals, e.g.,

> 1 Introduction

or

> 6.1 File Format

### Footnotes

Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9 point font.
They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other symbols.
Footnotes should be separated from the text by a line.

### Figures and tables

Place figures and tables in the paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if possible.
Wide figures/tables may run across both columns.

To accommodate people who are color-blind (as well as those printing with black-and-white printers), grayscale readability is strongly encouraged.
Color is not forbidden, but authors should ensure that tables and figures do not rely solely on color to convey critical distinctions.

**Captions:**
Provide a caption for every figure/table; number each one sequentially in the form:

> Figure 1: Caption of the Figure.

and

> Table 1: Caption of the Table.

Captions should be placed below figures/tables, in 10 point roman type.
Captions that are one line are centered.
Captions longer than one line are left-aligned.

### Hyperlinks

Within-document and external hyperlinks should be dark blue (hex #000099), not underlined or boxed.

### Non-English Text

Text in languages other than English should be accompanied by translations into English, and text in scripts other than Latin should *also* be accompanied by transliterations into Latin script, since not all readers can recognize non-Latin characters easily.

For example, παράδειγμα *paradeigma* ‘example’ is a Greek word, and this is a Greek sentence:

> Αυτό είναι ένα παράδειγμα.  
> auto einai ena paradeigma.  
> ‘This is an example.’

### Citations

Citations within the text appear in parentheses (Gusfield, 1997), or, if the author's name appears in the text itself: Gusfield (1997).
Append lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguities.
Cite papers with two authors using both authors' names (Aho and Ullman, 1972), but cite papers with more than two authors by the first author's name and "et al." (Chandra et al., 1981).
Collapse multiple citations into a single pair of parentheses (Gusfield, 1997; Aho and Ullman, 1972).

Refrain from using full citations as sentence constituents.
Instead of

> (Gusfield, 1997) showed that ...  
> In (Gusfield, 1997), ...''

write

> Gusfield (1997) showed that ...  
> In Gusfield (1997), ...

Submissions should accurately reference prior and related work, including code and data.
If a piece of prior work appeared in multiple venues, the version that appeared in a refereed, archival venue should be referenced.
If multiple versions of a piece of prior work exist, the one used by the authors should be referenced.

### Acknowledgments

The acknowledgments should go immediately before the references.
Do not number the acknowledgments section.
Do not include this section in the review version.

### References

Gather the full set of references together under the unnumbered section heading **References**.
Place the References section before any Appendices.
Arrange the references alphabetically by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.

Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format, such as the [one for Computational Linguistics](http://cljournal.org/style_guide_refs.html) or the one in the [Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/products/publication-manual-7th-edition).
Use full names for authors, not just initials.
Authors should not rely on automated citation indices to provide accurate references for prior and related work.

As part of our work to make ACL materials more widely used and cited outside of our discipline, ACL has registered as a CrossRef member, as a registrant of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), the standard for registering permanent URNs for referencing scholarly materials.

All references are required to contain DOIs of all cited works when possible, or, as a second resort, links to ACL Anthology pages.
Appropriate records should be found for most materials in the current [ACL Anthology](https://aclweb.org/anthology/).

Example article in a journal:

## Appendices

Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper.
Letter them in sequence and provide an informative title:

> Appendix A. Title of Appendix

The appendices come after the references.

Review versions of appendices must follow the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper.

## Supplementary Material

Submissions may include non-readable supplementary material used in the work and described in the paper.
Any accompanying software and/or data should include licenses and documentation of research review as appropriate.
Supplementary material may report preprocessing decisions, model parameters, and other details necessary for the replication of the experiments reported in the paper.
Seemingly small preprocessing decisions can sometimes make a large difference in performance, so it is crucial to record such decisions to precisely characterize state-of-the-art methods.

Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper.
**Submissions that misuse the supplementary material may be rejected without review.**
Supplementary material may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data.
(Source code and data should be separate uploads, rather than part of the paper).

The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to the reviewers, they will not be asked to review the supplementary material.

Review versions of supplementary material must follow the same anonymity guidelines as the main paper.

## Final version information

Below are the general *ACL policies for preparing the final version of your paper (sometimes still anachronistically called the "camera-ready").

If your question is not answered here, please email the current publications chairs for any questions or clarifications.

### How should the final version differ from the submitted version?

The final version of your paper should incorporate the comments of the reviewers as well as other changes you see fit to make.
In addition, be sure to do all of the following:

- Ensure that your paper conforms to the provided styles, font and page size.
- Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title.
- De-anonymize references to your own work in the body of the paper.
- Where appropriate, add acknowledgments for colleagues, reviewers, and grants.
  Do not number the Acknowledgments section.
  Please note that the acknowledgment section should fit within the allowed page limits and be in the same font as the rest of the paper.
- Ensure that all tables, graphs, and figures are readable at standard resolutions.
- If you have supplemental material (including written material, data, and/or code) ensure that all the components are put at the right place
 (see the [Appendices and supplemental material](#where-do-appendices-and-supplemental-material-go) section below for more details).

### How can I make my final paper version more accessible?

As a central venue of publication for our community, please prioritize the accessibility of your final version.
The Diversity & Inclusion committee for ACL2020 has outlined some tips on how to do this: https://acl2020.org/blog/accessibility-for-camera-ready/

### Where do appendices and supplemental material go?

Supplemental material can be divided into two types: appendices and non-readable supplemental material.

- Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper.
  In your final camera-ready paper, appendices come after the references in the main paper and use the same two-column format as the rest of the paper.
  An example can be found in [the style templates](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates).
  Appendices do not count towards the page limit.
- Non-readable supplemental material (data, software, all other material) is uploaded separately.

### How long can it be?

For both long and short papers, most *ACL conferences allow one extra page to help address reviewer comments.
So long papers are permitted at most 9 pages of text while short papers may use up to 5 pages of text.
Acknowledgments are included in these limits on pages of text.
Please use the extra space to help address reviewer comments.
For both long and short papers, there is no page limit for references or appendices.

If you are unsure about the page limit for the conference, please contact your conference publication chairs.

### What is the format for the final version?

The file must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on A4 paper.
You should use [the provided templates](https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/tree/master/templates).
You can view the style files and detailed formatting instructions on your conference website.

If you are using LaTeX, please create the PDF file with `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.
This ensures use of the proper fonts and also takes advantage of other PDF features.
You will have the best results using a modern LaTeX distribution, in particular, [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/).
Using the geometry package (as is done in the templates) to set the A4 format is recommended.

### How do I ensure that my file is correctly formatted?

- [Make sure the paper is A4](#format-size)
- [Embed custom fonts](#format-fonts)

   <a name="format-size"></a>
-  **Checking the paper size**.
   Your paper needs to be formatted to A4.
   Here are a couple of ways to check this:
      <ul>
      <li>
      Using pdfinfo. The `pdfinfo` command should include

            Page size:      595.276 x 841.89 pts

        in its output.
      </li>
      <li>
      Using Apple's Preview.app. Open the PDF, and type &#8984-I. It should report the
        correct page size.

      </li>
      <li>
      Using Adobe Acrobat. Open the PDF, navigate to File, Properties..., Description. The
        field labeled "Page Size" should read 8.27 × 11.69 inches in.

      </li>
      </ul>

   <a name="format-fonts"></a>
- **Embedding Fonts**.
  You can check your final PDF with the command `pdffonts mypaper.pdf` and confirm that all the fonts say "yes" under "emb".
  START will not let you upload your final PDF otherwise.
  If you are including graphics with the PDF extension, these files must also have embedded fonts.
  If your paper uses Asian fonts, they must be embedded in the PDF file so that they can be displayed by non-Asian versions of the PDF reader (Asian versions ship with a larger set of default fonts.)

### What should I know about graphics?

Your paper must look good both when printed (A4 size) and when viewed onscreen as PDF (zoomable to any size, color okay).
Thus, you may want to use color high-resolution graphics, allowing onscreen readers to zoom in on a graph and study it.
Ideally, you should use vector graphic formats (PDF, EPS), which allow the graphics to scale arbitrarily and provide the best result.
Avoid GIF or JPEG images, especially ones that are low resolution or contain visible lossy compression artifacts.
Note that vector graphics (e.g., encapsulated PostScript) look good at any scale and take up little space (unless you are plotting many thousands of data points).

You are strongly advised to check that all figures, tables, and images in your paper are legible when printed in black and white.

### How do I enter metadata?

It is very important that your paper's metadata (title, author names, and abstract) is entered correctly.
This information is used in a number of places, including generating the BibTeX and in creating the paper page in the Anthology (e.g., https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.448/), which is crawled by search engines such as DBLP, Semantic Scholar, and Google Scholar.

Exactly how you enter metadata will vary based on what conference management tool is being used.
[Information for START can be found here](formatting-start.html)
Please note carefully the following information:

* Unicode (UTF-8) can be used for accented or special characters.

* Names are **not** written in all caps or all lowercase.

* The "Last Name" is the name(s) by which your paper is to be cited.
  It is usually a family name, even for authors from cultures where the family name is written first.
  If you have only one name, please enter it here.

* The "First Name" is usually a given name or names, including middle names/initials.

The metadata should be written using Unicode (UTF-8) with LaTeX commands.
Please try to follow these guidelines:

 - In titles, please capitalize the first word, the first word
   after a colon (`:`), and all other words except the following
   "little words": articles, prepositions, coordinating
   conjunctions, and the infinitive marker "to." This includes
   hyphenated words like `Mixed-Case`.

 - In many bibliography styles, including ACL's, BibTeX lowercases
   the titles of conference papers, and needs to be told which letters
   _not_ to lowercase. This is handled by using curly braces around
   such terms: e.g., `{E}nglish`, `{C}homsky`, `{IBM}`, `{CFG}s`, `{HMM}s`.
   *As of 2020, this protection is now applied automatically* upon
   ingestion to the Anthology by means of heuristics (applied to CamelCase
   and UPPERCASE terms, and after punctuation) and a [very long curated list](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/blob/master/bin/fixedcase/truelist) of proper nouns and phrases. As such there is *no need
   for you to apply your own case protection*, unless your paper
   title contains a very uncommon proper noun.

   Note that curly braces will _not_ appear in the online conference
   program or proceedings. They will only appear in the BibTeX file
   that others will use to cite your paper.

 - If you need literal curly braces, please escape them like this:
   `\{` `\}`

 - Please don't use any nonstandard LaTeX commands, and there should
   be no `\footnote`s or citations using `\cite` or related commands.

 - You can use LaTeX math mode where appropriate: `An $O(n^2)$
   Algorithm for $n$-gram Smoothing`.

 - You can use Unicode (UTF-8) for accented or special characters.

Please note the following common errors when inputting abstracts:

 - If you copy-and-paste from your PDF file, please be sure to rejoin words broken by hyphenation.

 - If you copy-and-paste from the LaTeX source, please update any citations to their rendered form
   (e.g., *Brown et al. (1993)* instead of `\citet{brown-etal-1993-mathematical}`). You should also
   look out for other commands, such as `\footnote`, which cannot be easily dealt with

 - Many minor LaTeX commands, mostly related to formatting and simple math, are supported, and do not need to be removed: for example, `\textbf`, `\emph`, and math subscripts and superscripts.
   When in doubt, you should replace them with rendered versions, or directly wth Unicode.

### What about copyright?

When you submit the paper, you will be asked to sign the [ACL Copyright Transfer Agreement](https://github.com/ACLPUB/blob/master/templates/copyright/acl-copyright-transfer.pdf) on behalf of all authors, either electronically (via the START Conference Manager) or physically.
Authors retain many rights under this agreement and it is appropriate in the vast majority of cases.
Please contact the publication chairs with any concerns regarding copyright.

Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and, if applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to sign on their behalf.
Please sign your full name (not just your first or last initials).
