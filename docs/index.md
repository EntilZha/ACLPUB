Welcome to the website for ACL publication chairs.

Serving as publication chair is one of the most feared jobs in the ACL
community.  To a large degree, this is because the workload of a
publication chair is considerable, but the work itself is largely
invisible from the outside.  While most people who are asked to be
program chair for the first time have at least a rough idea of what
this means because they have been reviewers before, first-time
publication chairs tend to be confused and overwhelmed because they
have no idea what they signed up for.

This site is meant to alleviate this situation by collecting
information that is helpful or relevant to publication chairs.  It was
set up by Alexander Koller and Yusuke Miyao, the publication chairs
for ACL 2014.  This site is based on the fantastic groundwork laid by
earlier publication chairs, in particular Joakim Nivre and Noah Smith
(2008) and Jing-Shin Chang, Stefano Faralli, and Roberto Navigli
(2013), who documented the responsibilities and workflow for their
years.  We are moving the information to this editable place, in the
hope that future publication chairs will edit this website to keep it
up-to-date forever.
